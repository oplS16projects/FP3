Hi, I'm not really quite sure how to formally request written permission for groups larger than three. If I need to submit a more formal request, please let me know. 

# FP3 - Team Declaration
Due Friday, March 25, 2016.
Once you have your team figured out, **make a single pull request** for your whole team describing:
* who's on it (using github usernames and real names)
* James Erardi (jwerardi), Tyler Bainbridge (tylerjbainbridge), Alex Cushing (alexcushing) 


* a team name (for use in creating the group on github. Short and sweet.)
* Prism

* a project title (10 words or fewer, can be changed later)
* MongoDB Blog Posts for Prism

* a basic project concept
* In our GUI II project sequence course with Professor Jesse Heines, the three of us are creating a minimalistic photography portfolio social media website. We want to integrate a racket based backend system for Developer Blog posts. We plan to use the mongoDB racket library to create a new database collection for Blogs. We will update these blogs, via racket, everytime we implement a new feature for our GUI II website. 
* what libraries you plan on using, as a group 
* MongoDB, possibly Continue: Web Applications in Racket
