Team Name: Turkish Twist

Project Name: Sudoku Solver

Project Description: In this project, we will create a racket program that will allow the
user to enter a sudoku and then watch as it is solved using a brute force algorithm.  The
program can be run instantly, or it can be set to a "slower" mode, so that the user can 
watch and understand the solver's algorithm.

Libraries we intend to use: racket/gui/base and more TBA
