# Team Scratchket
Who we are:
Brian Thomas (jumpyhoof)

Team Name: Team Scratchket

Title: Scratchket, a graphical interface and representation of Racket data structures.

Concept: Scratchket will be a graphical representation of Racket data structures. It will be based off of Scratch's method of visually representing code. "Scratchket" would allow the user to move "data" and combine them with "procedure machines" to create a visually different output. For example, dragging 2 pieces of data and placing them together with the "cons machine" to create a visual representation of a cons cell.

Libraries: 
GL: 3-D Graphics
