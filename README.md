#Summary:
	Our project will be an implementation of the standard game of checkers with various AI difficulties that can 
	
	be played against. The difficulties will be normal, hard, and impossible.  Our intention is to program the
	
	normal difficulty to play like someone with	moderate knowledge of how to play the game beyond the rules.  The 
	
	hard difficulty would employ more in-depth AI that will play the game like a seasoned player.  Impossible will 
	
	be our attempt at creating an AI that will always beat a human player or tie in the event of a “perfect game.” 
	
	This last mode will likely be a reach goal as it was only accomplished in 2007 by Jonathan Schaeffer at	the 
	
	University of Alberta.  Might be difficult to implement in Racket but it seems like an interesting goal if the 
	
	algorithms are	public.  We have been to their website but lots of the pages surrounding their paper on the 
	
	solution are down.
