Team Name:
The Mathletes

Project Title:
Math Adventures

Project Concept:
Some of the smartest people still can't do basic arithmitic. Say goodbye to boring flashcards and hello to a new fun innovative way to learn basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division! Our team is going to set out to create a game that makes learning fun. It will allow users to select a character and then move over tiles to collect a specific number of items that solve a basic arithmitic problem. Users will have to collect the correct number of items before a timer runs out. Every time the user solves a problem correctly they are awarded points!    

Libraries We Plan to Use:
* We plan on using the racket/draw library because it provides basic drawing tools. 
* We also would like to use the racket/gui library because it provides GUI widgets such as windows, buttons, checkboxes and text fields.
(A text field will be placed at the top of the screen to display the arithmitic problem). 
* Lastly we would like to use the 2htdp/image and 2htdp/planetcute libraries. The image library is used for construction of basic images and the planet cute library provide images that are designed to be overlaid with each other to build scenes for use in games.
