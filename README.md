# FP3 - Team Declaration
Due Friday, March 25, 2016.
Once you have your team figured out, **make a single pull request** for your whole team describing:
* who's on it (using github usernames and real names)
* a team name (for use in creating the group on github. Short and sweet.)
* a project title (10 words or fewer, can be changed later)
* a basic project concept
* what libraries you plan on using, as a group
