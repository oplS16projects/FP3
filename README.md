## Project Concept:
The idea behind our project is to combine various team members FP libraries into
one final program. One member, Jason, created a small racket program that pulls
down weather data from a Weather API called [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/).
JT and Huy explored the racket turtle library and made various shapes. Our idea is
to combine the weather data from OpenWeatherMap into some sort of visualization using
drawing libraries in Racket, such as Racket Turtle or racket/draw. We may also play
around with the Racket Graph library. Jason will work on the Weather API portion
to gather data that can be fed into racket programs that JT and Huy will create,
and these programs will create a visualization for the weather data collected.
