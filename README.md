# FP3 - Team Declaration
Due Friday, March 25, 2016.
Once you have your team figured out, **make a single pull request** for your whole team describing:
* who's on it (using github usernames and real names)
* a team name (for use in creating the group on github. Short and sweet.)
* a project title (10 words or fewer, can be changed later)
* a basic project concept
* what libraries you plan on using, as a group

TEAM: Crying Jordans

A twitter app for the racket user. 

Members:
* Nick Finocchiaro -github username: nickfinocchiaro
* Harrison Dejardins-github username: HTdejardins

Concept:
A lightweight app that will allow a user to login to their twitter account, post tweets, retweet, and search tweets based on a hash tag. 

We plan on interfacing with the twitter API and creating a gui that will allow a user to enter their login information in the gui to
post, retweet, and search. 



To submit: make a pull request. One pull request for the whole team.
