Team Members: (GitCauble, Ryan Cauble) ; (Mulks , Cody Mulkern)

Team Name: (C&M Programming)

Project Title: (Visual Data)

Project Concept:
      The basic concept of this project will be to input data form an 
outside file, which will be used to produce a 3D representation of that 
data.

An example of this would be to take in data from multiple car dealerships
sales. This data could be stored into a database in racket. We could then 
use this data to perform statistical analysis and display our results
in a 3D graph.

We are still working on the exact details of the project.

What libraries we plan on usin as a group:
