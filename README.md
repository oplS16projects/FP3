# FP3 - Team Declaration
Due Friday, March 25, 2016.

Team Members: Josh Blanchette, Connor Finegan, Rob (maybe)

Team Name:  Chess Mates, or We Spent All Knight Coding

Project Title: Chess Schemers

Our basic project concept: Our team is planning on implementing the game of chess.  We plan on starting at the basics and mechanics of chess.  Then, if time allows, we will implement other features like an AI to play against, or customizable boards.  The possibilites are endless, so we will not run out of work to do with this project.

We plan on using the universe library and the 2D library for the chess board itself.  I'm sure we will dive into a couple more as well as we continue with this project.
