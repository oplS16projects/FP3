# FP3 - Team Declaration
Due Friday, March 25, 2016.

# Ken's Bold Team
I, **John David Brown**, am teaming up with **Michael A Antrobus** for the Final Project.

Although our idea is not set in stone, we shall adapt to any challenges brought forth, and expand our project as needed.

# Sports Statistics Interactive
Our goal is currently to expand upon my [FP1](https://github.com/JDBJohnBrown/FP1) and [FP2](https://github.com/JDBJohnBrown/FP2) projects to make them into a full fleshed out piece of software.

### This entails:
* expanding on PHP _POST requests to both retrieve and UPDATE stats in a MySQL database.
* parsing complicated strings to minimize data usae between the server and racket
* displaying data in graphically appealing way
* having mouse and keyboard interation with the program
* and much more...

# Libraries
* (net/url)
* (2htdp/image)
* (2htdp/universe)
* more...

#GitHub Accounts.

Guess ***who*** is ***who*** (John Brown is definately Aurelas)



#After Thoughts
I can flesh this declaration out more if needed, but we've only just met today. We're still working on a concrete plan for a final project, and only settled on expanding my projects because it's the only idea either of us has proposed so far.
