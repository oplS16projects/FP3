# FP3 - Team Declaration


Who's On it?
* George Mitwasi (georgemitwasi)
* Alex Gribov (agribov)
* Kevin Dibble (...)


Team Name
* Our team name is pending... for now let's call it "Digital Bubblebath"


Project Title
* Finding Code in Music. Title explanation: Rather than composing music through conventional songwriting techniques, we plan to compose music through algorithms.


Project Concept
*  Our goal is to generate music using high-level algorithmic procedures as input to a synthesizer. That's the basic concept. In addition, we'd like to seed the music with live MIDI input and have further control of the songwriting and sound design through external hardware.


Libraries
* Overtone (this will be our main libarary for algorithmic-music composition)
* Max/MSP (this isn't a library. it's a software to create synthesizers)
* Possible an HTTP library as a means to connect Racket with Max/MSP.
